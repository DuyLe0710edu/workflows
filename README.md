# Workflows

This repository contains all bioinformatics workflows used on the St. Jude Cloud project. Officially, the repository is in beta â€” the project is adding workflows as they are developed and put into production.

## Getting Started

At the time of writing, all workflows are written in [WDL][wdl] and are tested using [Cromwell][cromwell]. Although we do not test outside of Cromwell, we expect that the workflows will work just as well using other runners.

The easiest way to get started is to install [bioconda][bioconda] and the run the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n workflows-dev -c bioconda cromwell==0.40 -y
conda activate workflows-dev
git clone git@github.com:stjudecloud/workflows.git
cd workflows
```

Any of the workflows in [the workflows](https://github.com/stjudecloud/workflows/tree/master/workflows) folder is a good place to start, e.g.

```bash
cromwell run workflows/reference/bootstrap-reference.wdl --inputs workflows/reference/inputs.json
```

## Repository Structure

The repository is laid out as follows:

* `conf` - Cromwell configuration files created for various environments that we use across our team. Feel free to use/fork/suggest improvements.
* `docker` - Dockerfiles used in our workflows. All docker images are published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/stjudecloud).
  * At the time of writing, there is only one Docker image heavily in use, which is our [bioinformatics base image](./docker/bioinformatics-base/Dockerfile).
* `tools` - All tools we have wrapped as individual WDL tasks.
* `workflows` - Directory containing all end-to-end bioinformatics workflows.

## Workflows Available

## Tests

Given that this repo is still new, there are no tests. When we add tests, we will update the README.
